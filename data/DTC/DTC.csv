 ECU VIN mismatch with vehicle VIN; DTC id = 6AFAFF, status = 0; 6AFAFF;7FA6A; 0;1;"The application TUU receives the CAN message VI from source address EE (Tacho) and 00 (Engine). Inside
that message there is the vehicle VIN.
If VIN received from CAN doesn?t match with VIN writed inside PCM the TUU set that fault as active. If VIN
match again the fault is set as not active.
If on your vehicle the fault is active this means that TUU is receiving a different VIN, or can means that TUU
received a different VIN in past and never received the right one after that"
 ECU not configured since last VIN write or VIN missing; DTC id = 6BFAFF, status = 0; 6BFAFF;0x4A; 0;1;"The error is triggered if PCM does not receive default configuration
(""Boostrap"") after PCM activation.
The check is designed in this way:
? After VIN update (first VIN write in plant or any others
occurrence of VIN modified) the DTC is activated.
? After the board receive the new configurations (Bootstrap)
the DTC is deactivated.
Operator must wait until next PCM tracking ECUMSI data sending
to verify if the fault is no longer present.
Several sendings are done per day each 15 min between 7:00 and 20:00"

Reason: The Cyber Security anomaly can be wrongly triggered on old mist (like in Bundle 1.0.0)

not consider this fault and to filter on MIND. Same request has been to Diagnostic Electronic
team to mask this faults on reading fault/delivery operation on MIND (but still not implemented).

 DSE - comfort feature not available (sensor failure); DTC id = 99FAE2, status = 0; 99FAE2;7FA99; 0;1;"DSE application of PCM implements a sensor-based passenger comfort feature. When one of those sensors is in failure
mode (when PCM detects its DTC in the DM1 of sensor?s ECU), the comfort feature is disabled, and the driver is warned of
the situation via the PCM DM1 containing 0x99FAE2 DTC. Sensors used by DSE are YRS, AYS, SAS, suspensions
pressure and deflection sensors.
Resolution steps: depends on the fault detected in DM1 as PCM input.
MOST OF THE TIME, the PCM DM1 is thrown due to EBS sensors that are not calibrated.
1. Proceed to a default extraction using MIND/UDT. Look for any EBS or ELC5 DTC.
2. Verify that EBS sensors have been calibrated using MIND/UDT
a) If not, proceed to sensors calibration using MIND/UDT
(this must be done after every new software loaded in EBS via MIND/UDT)
b) If after last steps the problem is still up, contact engineering team.
Engineering: send READ_DTC_SQL and READ_DM1_SQL command to check if
1. PCM DM1 is still active
2. One of the DSE ?forbidden DTCs? is active"
